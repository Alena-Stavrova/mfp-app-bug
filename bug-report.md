## User can't add a newly created recipe to diary - Myfitnesspal app

### Description

When a user creates a recipe manually and clicks on “Add to diary”, an error message appears (see the screenshot in the repo)

### Steps to reproduce:

1. Navigate to Recipes, Meals and Foods section.

2. Go to Recipes section.

3. Click on “Create a recipe” and choose the option to enter the ingredients manually.

4. Add the recipe name and the number of servings.  

5. Add ingredients and their amounts and click “Next”

6. Click “Save”

7. Click “Add to diary”

Actual result: error message “An unexpected error occurred”

Expected result: a screen where a user can specify the details (e.g. number of servings and meal) and add the recipe to the diary.

### Note:
There is a workaround: a user can dismiss the error message and add the newly created recipe through Add food - My recipes.
